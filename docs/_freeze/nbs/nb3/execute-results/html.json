The merge conflict exercise we'll start with during the lab will assume that you have this background information.\n\n# Getting started\n\nGo to the course GitHub organization and locate your lab repo, which should be named `lab-03-nobel-laureates-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`.\nGrab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio.\nFirst, open the R Markdown document `lab-03.Rmd` and Knit it.\nMake sure it compiles without errors.\nThe output will be in the file markdown `.md` file with the same name.\n\n## Warm up\n\nBefore we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.\n\n-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document.\n-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n-   Push your changes to GitHub.\n-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files. If anything is missing, commit and push again.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling.\nThis package is already installed for you.\nYou can load them by running the following in your Console:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe dataset for this assignment can be found as a CSv (comma separated values) file in the `data` folder of your repository.\nYou can read it in using the following.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# nobel <- read_csv(\"data/nobel.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe variable descriptions are as follows:\n\n-   `id`: ID number\n-   `firstname`: First name of laureate\n-   `surname`: Surname\n-   `year`: Year prize won\n-   `category`: Category of prize\n-   `affiliation`: Affiliation of laureate\n-   `city`: City of laureate in prize year\n-   `country`: Country of laureate in prize year\n-   `born_date`: Birth date of laureate\n-   `died_date`: Death date of laureate\n-   `gender`: Gender of laureate\n-   `born_city`: City where laureate was born\n-   `born_country`: Country where laureate was born\n-   `born_country_code`: Code of country where laureate was born\n-   `died_city`: City where laureate died\n-   `died_country`: Country where laureate died\n-   `died_country_code`: Code of country where laureate died\n-   `overall_motivation`: Overall motivation for recognition\n-   `share`: Number of other winners award is shared with\n-   `motivation`: Motivation for recognition\n\nIn a few cases the name of the city/country changed after laureate was given (e.g. in 1975 Bosnia and Herzegovina was called the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia).\nIn these cases the variables below reflect a different name than their counterparts without the suffix \\`\\_original\\`.\n\n-   `born_country_original`: Original country where laureate was born\n-   `born_city_original`: Original city where laureate was born\n-   `died_country_original`: Original country where laureate died\n-   `died_city_original`: Original city where laureate died\n-   `city_original`: Original city where laureate lived at the time of winning the award\n-   `country_original`: Original country where laureate lived at the time of winning the award\n\n# Exercises\n\nTake turns answering the exercises.\nMake sure each team member gets to commit to the repo by the time you submit your work.\nAnd make sure that the person taking the lead for an exercise is sharing their screen.\nYou don't have to switch at each exercise, you can find your a cadence that works for your team and stick to it.\n\n## Get to know your data\n\n1.  How many observations and how many variables are in the dataset? Use inline code to answer this question. What does each row represent?\n\nThere are some observations in this dataset that we will exclude from our analysis to match the Buzzfeed results.\n\n2.  Create a new data frame called `nobel_living` that filters for\n\n-   laureates for whom `country` is available\n-   laureates who are people as opposed to organizations (organizations are denoted with `\"org\"` as their `gender`)\n-   laureates who are still alive (their `died_date` is `NA`)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nConfirm that once you have filtered for these characteristics you are left with a data frame with  observations, once again using inline code.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n## Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes\n\n... says the Buzzfeed article.\nLet's see if that's true.\n\nFirst, we'll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize.\nWe'll use the `mutate()` function for this.\nThe following pipeline mutates the `nobel_living` data frame by adding a new variable called `country_us`.\nWe use an if statement to create this variable.\nThe first argument in the `if_else()` function we're using to write this if statement is the condition we're testing for.\nIf `country` is equal to `\"USA\"`, we set `country_us` to `\"USA\"`.\nIf not, we set the `country_us` to `\"Other\"`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nNote that we can achieve the same result using the `fct_other()` function we've seen before (i.e. with `country_us = fct_other(country, \"USA\")`). We decided to use the `if_else()` here to show you one example of an if statement in R.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# nobel_living <- nobel_living %>%\n#   mutate(\n#     country_us = if_else(country == \"USA\", \"USA\", \"Other\")\n#   )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# nobel_living_science <- nobel_living %>%\n  # filter(category %in% c(\"Physics\", \"Medicine\", \"Chemistry\", \"Economics\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFor the next exercise work with the `nobel_living_science` data frame you created above.\nThis means you'll need to define this data frame in your R Markdown document, even though the next exercise doesn't explicitly ask you to do so.\n\n3.  Create a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize.\n    Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed headline is supported by the data.\n\n    -   Your visualization should be faceted by category.\n    -   For each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\n    -   Flip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.d*\n\n## But of those US-based Nobel laureates, many were born in other countries\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** You should be able to ~~cheat~~ borrow from code you used earlier to create the `country_us` variable.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n4.  Create a new variable called `born_country_us` that has the value `\"USA\"` if the laureate is born in the US, and `\"Other\"` otherwise.\n    How many of the winners are born in the US?\n\n5.  Add a second variable to your visualization from Exercise 3 based on whether the laureate was born in the US or not.\n    Based on your visualization, do the data appear to support Buzzfeed's claim?\n    Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.\n\n    -   Your final visualization should contain a facet for each category.\n    -   Within each facet, there should be a bar for whether the laureate won the award in the US or not.\n    -   Each bar should have segments for whether the laureate was born in the US or not.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n## Here's where those immigrant Nobelists were born\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nNote that your bar plot won't exactly match the one from the Buzzfeed article. This is likely because the data has been updated since the article was published.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n6.  In a single pipeline, filter for laureates who won their prize in the US, but were born outside of the US, and then create a frequency table (with the `count()` function) for their birth country (`born_country`) and arrange the resulting data frame in descending order of number of observations for each country. Which country is the most common?\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.*\n\nNow go back through your write up to make sure you've answered all questions and all of your R chunks are properly labelled.\nOnce you decide as a team that you're done with this lab, all members of the team should pull the changes and knit the R Markdown document to confirm that they can reproduce the report.\n\n# Interested in how Buzzfeed made their visualizations?\n\nThe plots in the Buzzfeed article are called waffle plots.\nYou can find the code used for making these plots in Buzzfeed's GitHub repo (yes, they have one!) [here](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2017-01-immigration-and-science/).\nYou're not expected to recreate them as part of your assignment, but you're welcomed to do so for fun!",
